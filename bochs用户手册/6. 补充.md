## 1. 创建一个简单的disk image 

### 1.1 第一种方法：`dd`命令

You will need to know the geometry of the disk you want to create. You have to compute the disk sector count:

```
Sectors = Cylinders * Heads * SectorsPerTrack
```



Use the dd command to create your file:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=teaching.img bs=512 count=sectors
```

(replace "sectors" with the number you computed at the previous step).



When you'll update your configuration file, please fill in the same cylinders, heads and sector per track values.



### 1.2 第二种方法：`bximage`

```shell
========================================================================
                                bximage
  Disk Image Creation / Conversion / Resize and Commit Tool for Bochs
         $ID: bximage.cc 11906 2013-10-23 08:35:21Z vruppert $
========================================================================

1. Create new floppy or hard disk image
2. Convert hard disk image to other format (mode)
3. Resize hard disk image
4. Commit 'undoable' redolog to base image

0. Quit

Please choose one [0]
```

Since we want to create a new image, we have to type '1' and then **Enter**.

```shell
Do you want to create a floppy disk image or a hard disk image?
Please type hd or fd. [hd]
```



Since we are creating a hard disk image, accept the default of hd by pressing **Enter** or typing 'hd' and pressing **Enter**. Next, bximage will ask for the type of hd to create:

```shell
What kind of image should I create?
Please type flat, sparse, growing or vpc. [flat]
```



We want to create a simple flat image, so accept the default by pressing **Enter**. Then, bximage will ask for the size of the disk image you want to create, in Megabytes:

```shell
Enter the hard disk size in megabytes, between 1 and 8257535
[10]
```



Enter the size of the hard disk you want to create, and press **Enter**. Then bximage will ask you for a filename to use for the file it is creating.

```shell
What should be the name of the image?
[c.img]
```



At this point, type in the filename you want to use for the image. The default of "c.img" is appropriate if this will be your only hard disk image. After you have typed in the name of the filename you want to use, press **Enter**. Bximage will tell you it is writing the disk and then it will show you a line that should be added to your `bochsrc` when you want to use this disk image. I named my 10 Megabyte image "teaching.img" and the output of bximage looked like this:

```shell
[c.img] teaching.img

Creating hard disk image 'c.img' with CHS=20/16/63
```



The following line should appear in your `bochsrc`:

```shell
  ata0-master: type=disk, path="teaching.img", mode=flat, cylinders=20, heads=16, spt=63
```



At this point, a file called "teaching.img" was created in my current directory and is ready to be used as an image file for a Bochs session.

>   **Tip:** You may want to name your image `teaching_20-16-63.img` so that you always know the values to use for CHS.



## 2. image file分区/格式化
