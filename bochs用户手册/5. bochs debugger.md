## 1. 命令行调试器

### 1.1 执行控制

```shell
  c                           continue executing
  cont
  continue

  s     [count]               execute count instructions, default is 1
  step  [count]

  s     [cpu] [count]         for SMP simulation, execute count instructions on cpu,    
                              default is 1
  
  step  [cpu] [count]

  s     all [count]           for SMP simulation, execute count instructions on all cpus
  step  all [count]

  Ctrl-C                      stop execution, and return to command line prompt
  Ctrl-D                      if at empty line on command line, exit

  q                           quit debugger and execution
  quit
  exit
```



### 1.2 断点

```shell
  NOTE: The format of 'seg', 'off', and 'addr' in these descriptions,

### 1.4 内存查看/修改

```shell
  x  /nuf addr      Examine memory at linear address addr
  xp /nuf addr      Examine memory at physical address addr
     n              Count of how many units to display
     u              Unit size; one of
                      b Individual bytes
                      h Halfwords (2 bytes)
                      w Words (4 bytes)
                      g Giant words (8 bytes)
                      NOTE: these are *not* typical Intel nomenclature sizes,
                            but they are consistent with GDB convention.
     f              Printing format.  one of
                      x Print in hexadecimal
                      d Print in decimal
                      u Print in unsigned decimal
                      o Print in octal
                      t Print in binary

    n, f, and u are optional parameters.  u and f default to the last values
    you used, or to w(words) and x(hex) if none have been supplied.
    n currently defaults to 1.  If none of these optional parameters are
    used, no slash should be typed.  addr is also optional.  If you don't
    specify it, it will be the value the next address (as if you had
    specified n+1 in the last x command).

  setpmem addr datasize val    Set physical memory location of size
                               datasize to value val.

  writemem                     dump a number of bytes of virtual memory starting from
                               the specified linear address into a file

### 1.6 CPU寄存器查看/修改

```shell
  set reg = expr    Change a CPU register to value of expression.
                    Currently only general purpose registers and instruction pointer
                    are supported. You may not change eflags, segment registers,
                    floating point or SIMD registers.

    Examples: set eax = 2+2/2
              set esi = 2*eax+ebx

  registers         List of CPU registers and their contents
  regs
  reg
  r
```



### 1.7 反汇编命令

```shell
  disassemble start end       Disassemble instructions in given linear address
                              range, inclusive of start, exclusive of end.
                              Use "set $disassemble_size =" to tell
                              debugger desired segment size.  Use a value for
                              end of less than start (or zero) if you only
                              want the first instruction disassembled.

  disassemble switch-mode     Switch between Intel and AT&T disassebly styles
                              for debugger disassembler.

  disassemble size = n        Tell debugger what segment size to use when
                              the "disassemble" command is used.  Use values
                              of 0, 16 or 32 for n.  Value of 0 means
			      "use segment size specified by current CS
			      segment". Default is 0.

  set $auto_disassemble = n   Cause debugger to disassemble current instruction
                              every time execution stops if n=1.  Default is 0.
                              Segment size of current CPU context is used for
                              disassembly, so the "disassemble size" variable is
                              ignored.

  set disassemble on          The same as 'set $auto_disassemble = 1'
  set disassemble off         The same as 'set $auto_disassemble = 0'
```



### 1.8 指令追踪

```shell
  trace on                    Disassemble every executed instruction. Note
                              that instructions which caused exceptions are
                              not really executed, and therefore not traced.

  trace off                   Disable instruction tracing.
```

### 1.10 其它命令

```shell
ptime
Print the current time (number of ticks since start of simulation).
sb delta
Insert a time break point "delta" instructions into the future ("delta" is a 64-bit integer followed by "L", for example 1000L).
sba time
Insert a time break point at "time" ("time" is a 64-bit integer followed by "L", for example 1000L).
print-stack [num words]
Print the num words top 16-bit words on the stack. Num words defaults to 16. Only works reliably in protected mode when the base address of the stack segment is zero.
modebp
Toggles CPU mode switch breakpoint.
ldsym [global] filename [offset]
Load symbols from file filename. If the global keyword is added, then the the symbols will be visible in all contexts for which symbols have not been loaded. Offset (default is 0) is added to every symbol entry. The symbols are loaded in the current (executing) context.
The symbol file consists of zero or more lines of the format

"%x %s"
.
show [string]
  Toggles show symbolic info (calls to begin with).
  show - shows current show mode
  show mode     - show, when processor switch mode
  show int      - show, when interrupt is happens
  show call     - show, when call is happens
  show ret      - show, when iret is happens
  show off      - toggles off symbolic info
  show dbg-all  - turn on all show flags
  show dbg-none - turn off all show flags
```
